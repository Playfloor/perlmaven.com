=abstract start

I've been using <a href="/digitalocean">Digital Ocean</a> for many years for some of my hosting needs. Besides the nice GUI they also have an API
and there is a Perl module called <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DigitalOcean">DigitalOcean</a> that can be used to access it.

=abstract end

Before you get started you need to <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens">generate a new Token</a>.

Create a file called <b>.env</b> with the following content:
<code>
DIGITAL_OCEAN_TOKEN = THE_TOKEN
</code>

replacing <b>THE_TOKEN</b> by the token you generated.

Install the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DigitalOcean">DigitalOcean</a>
and the
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dotenv">Dotenv</a>  modules:

<code>
cpanm DigitalOcean Dotenv
</code>

<h2>List available images</h2>

This is a short example to <b>list the available images</b>:

<include file="examples/digitalocean/list_images.pl">

<h2>CLI</h2>

This is a longer example that will make it easy for you to list images, sizes, regions, ssh keys, or existing droplets.

It also allows you to create a new droplet. (That part currently has hard-coded values.)

This is currently primarily an experimental demo.
